3D Printing Instructions for STL Files

Before Printing:
- Find a 3D printer; make sure it is properly calibrated
- Have sufficient PLA filament (1.75 mm preferably)
- Download 3D printing software for making the .gcode files

Items to print:
- Shaft_Support (x1)
- LR_Gear (x1)
- PA_Gear (x1)
- LargeGear (x1)
- EvenLargerGear (x1)
- ICE_Support_Front (x1)
- ICE_Support_FrontTop (x1) 
- ICE_Support_Back (x1)
- ICE_Support_BackTop (x1)
- SmallGear_0.5X (x4)

Recommendation: There are three (3) variations of the SmallGear STL file, each having a different internal diameter (ID) in inches: 0.50, 0.51, and 0.52. 
Depending on the sizing error of your printer, print the gear with appropriate ID to make sure it fits the d-profile shaft.
